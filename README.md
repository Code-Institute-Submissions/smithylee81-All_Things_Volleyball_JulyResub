## About

An e-commerce website specifically relating to Volleyball clothing, accessories, and equipment, in other words ‘All Things Volleyball’. I, the developer, am a keen Volleyball player at Amateur level and play in a local club. Having an outdoor Tournament approaching I noticed that trying to find any volleyball related products seem to be on lots of different websites and I thought, why not have one place for everything I need? The website is designed to be responsive and accessible on a wide range of devices, making it easy for everyone to access and use whether they're on the go or sitting at a desktop.

I created the site to give an outdoor sun and beach feel in keeping with a beach volleyball theme. Sky & water blue colours with Sun yellow colours to achieve the theme.
